  Welcome to my World!
</h1>
<div class="left"> Many, many moons back, the story of a female princess warrior started right in the heart of Freetown in the Lions mountains of West Africa, Sierra Leone. The only child of her parents, this princess was called Yatiana, Suricia, Esther Conteh.  Though her journey started in Sierra Leone, it has not been static as it has seen her move through different geographic, personal and social locations as she maneuvers her way through life. Listen to the story she has to tell.  </div> <br>
